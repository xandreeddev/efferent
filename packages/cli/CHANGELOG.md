## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc24ae: shell: background processes + tmux interactive sessions, on a process-group-correct foundation.

  The `Shell` port was one-shot only (`exec` — blocking, pipes, no TTY), so nothing could outlive a tool call and an interactive program had no way to run. A research run that tried to "observe a TUI live" hacked `script -q -c '<tui>'` and hung the turn for 41 minutes: `exec` killed only the direct child on timeout, then blocked on `readAll` of a pipe a reparented orphan still held.

  - **Foundation — process-group correctness (`shell/local.ts`).** Commands now spawn in their own process group (`detached`), so a timeout/abort group-kills the whole tree (`script`/`setsid`/reparented orphans included), and the call settles on the process's **exit** plus a bounded drain grace — never on pipe EOF, so an fd-holding orphan can't hang it. This fixes the original hang and protects the verifier's long `exec` too.
  - **Background processes.** `Bash({ run_in_background: true })` returns a `processId` immediately; `bash_output` reads incremental output (with a cursor); `kill_bash` group-kills it. For dev servers, watchers, long builds. The Bash default timeout is also raised 60s → **5 min** (agent-overridable via `timeout`), kept independent from the verifier's 30-min cap.
  - **Interactive tmux sessions.** A new `TerminalSession` port (tmux-backed) + `session_start`/`session_send`/`session_read`/`session_kill`/`session_list` — drive a TUI/REPL/ssh, capture its screen, and `tmux attach` to the same pane. Feature-detected: no tmux ⇒ a graceful, model-readable failure.
  - **Visibility + teardown.** Background output surfaces live via a new `bg_output` event (same `RunContext` sink path as `llm_retry`); on app exit, all background procs and tmux sessions are group-killed so nothing is orphaned.

### Patch Changes

- f2d8f12: llm retries: clamp `Retry-After` and make the backoff visible — a rate-limit can no longer silently hang the turn.

  Two bugs compounded into a "frozen TUI for hours" symptom: the opencode gateway answers a daily-quota 429 with `Retry-After` = seconds-until-the-midnight-UTC reset (often 10+ hours), and `retryableLlm` (a) honored that verbatim — `Effect.sleep` for ~13h — and (b) reported retries only via `Effect.logWarning`, which the TUI routes to the file log, never the event stream. So the agent parked for half a day with the loader still spinning `thinking`, no error, no indication.

  - **Clamp.** A server wait is honored only up to a 60s ceiling; a longer one is treated as a quota/outage wall and **not retried** — the error surfaces immediately so you can switch models (`:model`) instead of staring at a hang. Exponential backoff is unchanged (1s→2s→4s, capped). The clamp decision is a pure, unit-tested function (`planDelay` / `parseRetryAfter`).
  - **Visibility.** Each backoff now emits an `llm_retry` event (new `AgentHooks.onLlmRetry` + `AgentEvent` variant), threaded from the provider adapter to the UI via a `RunContext` FiberRef sink (the adapter runs below the loop's hooks), and inherited by the sub-agent fleet. The TUI renders `provider HTTP 429 — retrying in 8s (attempt 1/3)` live. The hard failure, if retries exhaust, still arrives as the existing red error line.

- 77557f7: delegation: a _broad_ investigation now hands off to the research fleet instead of grinding through it serially in the master session. `# When to delegate`'s "do the investigating yourself" fast path gains an explicit exception, and a new `# Investigating & researching` prompt section (emitted only when a `research-coordinator` is in the roster) draws the read-side line the way `# Writing code` draws the write-side one: a focused lookup (one file/function/named thing) stays on the root, but the moment an answer means reading across many files or several areas at once — orienting in an unfamiliar codebase, mapping how modules connect, tracing a flow end-to-end, auditing multiple areas — it fans out parallel read-only researchers and synthesizes one sourced answer. Reading never conflicts, so the fan-out is pure speed-up and keeps the root's context clean. Fixes the recurring "the initial research that could be sped up by the swarm always runs in the master session instead" complaint. Prompt-only — the model still decides; this just makes the broad/focused split explicit. Covered by a new `researchDelegation` eval suite (natural prompts, deterministic trajectory scoring: broad → fans out with `minSpawns`, narrow → stays direct).
